export const authText = `In my recent work with Liifer Technologies I was responsible for nearly every 
aspect of the front-end for this large production app. This includes the authorization system for our users. The back-end uses 0Auth 2.0
so in the front-end I needed to handle the JWT tokens, update them when appropriate, and use them when when interacting with the back-end.
Google authentication and Discord authenication are available for logging in and signing up as well. I also configured Google Auth for the Ionic Capacitor (iOS and Android) ports, 
and they are also available in the Overwolf extension.`

export const restListText = `The back-end of the liifer app leverages a third party aggregator system to access over 800,000 restaurants all over North America.
With input from designers I created the restaurant list section of the application. The results for nearby restaurants are based off of the users location. As set through the google places API.
I was responsible making the google places API available to users, parsing this info to JSON and sending it to the back-end. These results are also searchable based off of restaurant name and cuisine types.
Under the hood this component uses the react-table library to handle the card positioning and search function.`
